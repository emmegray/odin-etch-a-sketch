# Odin Etch-a-sketch

Simple exercise based on the project Etch-a-Sketch from Odin to improve DOM manipulation skills with JS.

## Assignment

1. Create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs made with JavaScript
2. Set up hover effect so that the grid change color when the mouse passes over them (pixelated)
3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a pop-up asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.

Extra credit:
1. Rather than a color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely.
2. Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black square only after 10 interactions.
