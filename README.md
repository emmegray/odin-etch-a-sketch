# Odin Etch-a-sketch

Simple exercise based on the project Etch-a-Sketch from Odin to improve DOM manipulation skills with JS.

P.S. Sorry if it's all so messy and there are comments in Italian and English :c

## Assignment

1. Create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs made with JavaScript
2. Set up hover effect (mine is working both hover and by clicking) so that the grid change color when the mouse passes over them (pixelated)
3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a pop-up asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.

Extra credit:

1. Rather than a color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the square‚Äôs RGB value entirely. [ Done ‚úîÔ∏è ]

2. Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black square only after 10 interactions. [ WIP üõ†Ô∏è ]

Personal bonus:
Just for personal curiosity and fun I added the option to take a screenshot of the drawing and save it. [ Done ‚úîÔ∏è ]
